# 🔐 Genetic Algorithm Password Cracker – AI Coursework

This project demonstrating the use of genetic algorithms to guess passwords through evolution.

## 🧬 Features

- State representation: random alphanumeric string
- Fitness: character-by-character match
- Selection: fitness-proportionate
- Crossover: character-by-character parent mixing
- Mutation: adjustable mutation rate for diversity
- Plots for convergence and hyperparameter analysis

## 📂 Files

- `password_fitness.ipynb` – Notebook implementing the full GA and testing different settings

## 📊 Sample Result
